Welcome To CancelChain
======================

CancelChain is an open-source python project that implements a custom blockchain ledger. The ledger protocol allows for the assigning of tokens to subjects (utf-8 strings of less than 80 characters) as indications of either opposition or support. Opposition entries are allowed to be rescinded later. Support is forever.
